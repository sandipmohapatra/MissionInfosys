Sequence :- a sequence is a user created database object that can be shared by multiple users to generate unique integers.

a typical usage for sequences is to create a primary key value,which must be unique for each row.

example:-
create sequence xyz increment by 1 start with 1 maxvalue 999 nocache nocycle;

insert into class(rollno,name,section) values(xyz.nextval,'amit','a');

select xyz.nextval from dual;

select xyz.currval from dual;
