cursors:- cursors are used whenever one want to retrieve more than one record from the database.cursor is the amount of memory reserved to accomodate more than one row of the table.
cursor are divide into two types:-
1)implicit cursor
2)explicit cursor

implicit cursor:- oracle implicitly creates and open a cursor for every sql data manipulation statement that is not part of an explicit declared cursor.programmer has no control over this.

explicit cursor:-pl/sql programmer use explicit cursor only.the result of this cursor select statement can consist of more than one rows depending on query.

activeset:- it is a group of rows which are hold in the memory area of the cursor.

steps:-
1)declare (memory allocation)
2)open (activeset is created)
3)manipulation(loop/rows)
4)close(release the memory)


cursor attributes:-
-------------------------
1)%isopen :-when there is no activeset it will retrieve false and if is there activeset is true.return type is boolean.

2)%found:-to know whether the cursor pointer points to a valid row inside the cursor.we cannot fetch when no more rows available.return type is boolean.

3)%notfound:-(same) 

4)%rowcount:-it will retrieve the position of the pointer within the activeset .


example:-

declare
cursor c is select ename from emp ;
x varchar2(15);
begin
open c;
loop
fetch c into x;
exit when c %notfound; 
dbms_output.put_line(c %rowcount||'   '||x);
end loop;
end;
