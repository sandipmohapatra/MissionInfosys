 view:- 
A view is a logical table based on a table or another view.
a view contains no data of it's own .
the table on which the view is based is known as base table.

advantage :-
1)views restrict access to data because the view can display selective columns from the table.
2)views can be used to make simple queries to retrieve the results of complicated queries.
3)one view can be used to retrieve data from several tables.

simple view:-
1)Derives data from only one table.
2)contains no functions or groupby data.
3)can perform DML(data manupulation language insert,update,delete) operation

complex view:-
1)derives data from many table.
2)contains functions or group by data.
3)doesnot always allow DML operations.

example:-

1)create view xyz as select empno,ename from emp where deptno=10;
